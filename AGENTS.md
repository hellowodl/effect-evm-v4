# effect-evm-v4 Development Guidelines

AI agents working on effect-evm-v4 MUST follow these guidelines.

## Tech Stack

- **Effect**: Effect v4 (`4.0.0-beta.102`)
- **Language**: TypeScript v5.9+
- **Package Manager**: Bun with workspace catalogs
- **Task Runner**: Just
- **Linter and Formatter**: Biome (JS/TS/JSON), Prettier (MD/YAML)
- **Testing**: Vitest with @effect/vitest

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) v20+
- [Bun](https://bun.sh) package manager
- [Just](https://github.com/casey/just) command runner
- [Ni](https://github.com/antfu-collective/ni) package manager resolver (`na`, `ni`, `nr`, etc.)

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hellowodl/effect-evm-v4.git
cd effect-evm-v4
bun install
```

## Lint Rules

After generating code, run these commands **in order**.

**Command sequence:**

1. **Biome lint** — if JS/TS/JSON files changed
   - `na biome lint <files>`

2. **TypeScript check** — if TS files changed
   - Changed code in a single package? → `just type-check <package>`
   - Changed code across packages? → `just type-check-all`

3. **Run related tests** — if test files or test-related files changed
   - `na vitest <test-files>` — only run tests related to your changes, not the entire suite

If any command fails, fix errors before continuing.

## Repository Structure

## Commands

```bash
just --list            # Show all available commands
just full-check          # Run all code checks (prettier + biome + type check)
just full-write          # Auto-fix formatting and linting issues
just biome-check         # Check code with Biome
just build <package>     # Build a single package (e.g., just build evm)
just build-all           # Build all packages
just type-check <package> # TypeScript type check a single package
just type-check-all      # TypeScript type check all packages
just tu                  # Run unit tests
just ti                  # Run integration tests
just clean               # Clean dist, tsbuildinfo, tgz artifacts
just evm::build          # Build effect-evm-v4
just evm::test           # Test effect-evm-v4
just evm::tui            # Run effect-evm-v4 tests in UI mode
```

## Development Workflow

For external contributions:

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch from `main`
2. Make changes following this file and the nearest package `AGENTS.md`
3. Add tests for new features or behavior changes
4. Run `just full-check` before committing or opening a PR
5. Submit a pull request with a clear description of the change

## Quality Gates

Before submitting a pull request, ensure:

- Code is linted and formatted (`just full-check`)
- Unit tests pass (`just tu`)

## Environment Variables (dotenvx)

Secrets are managed with [dotenvx](https://dotenvx.com) (`@dotenvx/dotenvx`, root devDependency):

- **`.env`** — encrypted values + `DOTENV_PUBLIC_KEY`. Safe to commit; committed.
- **`.env.keys`** — `DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY` used for decryption. Gitignored; NEVER commit it.

Rules:

- Automated tests, including `just ti`, run without loading `.env` and must not receive API keys or secrets.
- Keep genuinely secret-backed integration suites in source but statically disabled with `describe.skip` or `it.skip`
  until they are intentionally re-enabled. Do not use `skipIf`, `runIf`, or environment-dependent enablement.
- CI test jobs must not declare or inject API keys or secrets.
- Add or update a secret with `na dotenvx set KEY value` (encrypts in place). Never write plaintext values into `.env`
  directly.
- Without `.env.keys`, dotenvx logs a `MISSING_PRIVATE_KEY` error and injects the literal `encrypted:...` string instead
  of the decrypted value. Code reading these vars must treat `encrypted:`-prefixed values as absent and degrade
  gracefully.
- Current locally managed key: `ROUTEMESH_API_KEY` — RouteMesh RPC load balancer
  (`https://lb.routeme.sh/rpc/CHAIN_ID/API_KEY`). It is not used by automated tests.

## Code Standards

### Naming Conventions

- **Directories**: `kebab-case` (e.g., `react-hooks`)
- **Files**: `kebab-case` (e.g., `primitives.ts`), except `PascalCase` for React components

### TypeScript

- Use `function` declarations for named functions
- Avoid `any`; use `unknown` if type is truly unknown
- Use `readonly` for immutable properties
- Use `satisfies` operator for type-safe constants

### Effect Patterns

- Use `Effect.gen` for generator-based composition
- Tag errors with `_tag` for discriminated unions
- Use `Layer` for dependency injection
- Use `Effect.sync` for synchronous effects, `Effect.promise` for async
- Prefer `yield*` over `yield` for Effect operations

## Module Structure

- Implementation files + `index.ts` barrel export per module
- Internal utilities in `internal/` (not exported)
- Tests co-located with source (`*.test.ts`)

## Testing

- Use `@effect/vitest` for Effect-specific matchers
- Test both success and failure cases
- Use descriptive test names

## Error Handling

- Tag errors with `_tag` for discriminated unions
- Use `Effect.fail` for expected errors, `Effect.die` for bugs
